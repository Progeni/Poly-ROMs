# POLY ROMs #

Permission has been gained from the authors and copyright holders (Neil Scott and Perce Harpham) to release these to the public.

This repo contains the dumps of the different version of the Poly 1 and Poly 2 ROMs
that have been seen throughout the Poly Preseration Project. Those vesions include

* Version 2.3
* Version 3.0
* Version 3.1
* Version 3.4
* Standalone Poly Version 3.4 (with disk drive)

directories with _b and _c (etc) extensions are duplicate copies seen on different physical Polys.  The BASIC ROMs (for all _b, etc) are identical
but the BIOS has a serial number built in, so the BIOSs are different.

The Standalone verison of the Poly ROMs is from a machine that had an external 5.25" floppy disk drive. The logon screen is red, not
the usual magenta.  It can boot disk locally as well as over the network.
